++++++Move .cpp and .h to Source/Log

Log.h :

++++++Add constexpr to operator>/<
++++++DRAK_LOG is more than 100 col
++++++Why is FATAL enumerator 30 and the predecessor is 10 ?
++++++inline before all

Log.cpp :

++++++Careful about pointer convention
++++++Careful some lines are more than 100col
Why did you use the C style file manager/opener ? use the C++ instead
Don't new time( create a local object instead ), just pass it like this "&time"
Watch this http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/chrono/localtime

Maybe you can save which files are opened to not re-opened them later.
Don't forget to close the file at the end;
