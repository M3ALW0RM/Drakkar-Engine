confusion in use of "s" in Vec2sc and Vec2sui
	Possible fix:
		use "s" instead of "si" to represent short
		use "usi" to follow the use of "u" to represent unsigned comming before the other letters in the abreviation
The same confusion in present in Vec3, Vec4, and Vec8

Rotate functions in Vec3, Vec4 not coded but callable
